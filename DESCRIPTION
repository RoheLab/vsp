Description: Provides fast spectral estimation of latent factors
    in random dot product graphs using the vsp estimator. Under mild
    assumptions, the vsp estimator is consistent for (degree-corrected)
    stochastic blockmodels, (degree-corrected) mixed-membership stochastic
    blockmodels, degree-corrected overlapping stochastic blockmodels.
